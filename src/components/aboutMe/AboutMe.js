            <p>Welcome to my personal website!
                My name is Stijn and I am a Java developer with a background in Business Engineering.
                I have a passion for programming and enjoy the challenges and rewards that come with it.
                I have had the opportunity to work in international workspaces and
                I find it to be a very enriching experience.
                I hope you find my website informative and interesting.
                Thanks for visiting!</p>
